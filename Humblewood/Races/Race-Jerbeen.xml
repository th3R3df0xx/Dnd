            <p>
Jerbeens are small mouse-like folk with long, furred tails
that help them balance. In proportion to the rest of their body,
a jerbeen’s legs are long and powerful. Jerbeens can be found in
a variety of places across the Wood, usually forming their own
communities within birdfolk perches and humblefolk villages.
Seldom do they live alone. A jerbeen’s home can contain
several generations, including extended family and cousins
living together under one roof. Jerbeens have a strong sense of
family and like to surround themselves with good company
wherever they rest.</p>
<h4>Outsize Courage</h4>
<p>Jerbeens are the smallest inhabitants of Humblewood,
dwarfed by nearly every kind of creature they encounter. While
they are quick and nimble, and possess an affable attitude,
they are not very strong, brave, or powerful on their own.
When they stand with a group, jerbeens are emboldened: the
presence of others reassures them, granting them the courage
to face even the largest threats head on. They excel in team
strategies, helping one another solve problems that could not
be surmounted alone.</p>
<h4>Community First</h4>
<p>The communal slant of jerbeens stems from more than just
their love of good company: jerbeen are kind and considerate
creatures, known for their joviality and charm. Being small
and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows
them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens
share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers
outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all
non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from
friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst
possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.</p>
