            <p>
            The avia-ra are a sun-worshipping race of wingless birdmen, which appear to primitive cultures to spread their ancient religion
            </p>
            <h4>Ancient God-Kings</h4>
            <p>
                Depictions of the avia-ra can be found in the ruins of ancient cultures throughout the galaxy. Often, but not always, they are portrayed as divinity manifest: god-like travelers from the heavens. They arrive as evangelists to share the philosophy of their solar religion—that the Sun Above is the only true god—and remain long enough to build an enduring civilization on the primitive world. Some races consider the avia-ra an ancient and wise people, dedicated to their religion and its tenets. Others cast them as charlatans and false prophets, who routinely prey upon primitive and defenseless peoples. The truth depends largely on perspective, but the avia-ra view themselves only as a grand tool to carry the momentum of the sun's glory to new peoples.    </p>

                </b>
                Avia-Ra are long lived, and due to their long lives, they have been revered as gods by more primitive beings. They reach maturity at roughly 30 years of age, and can live as long as 500 years.

                </b>
                The avia-ra draw their morality and philosophy from the sun. Though this solar religion can be severe, fatalistic, and dogmatic, most avia-ra have an inclination towards good—or at least lawful—alignments.
