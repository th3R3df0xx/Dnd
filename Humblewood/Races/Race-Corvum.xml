		<description>
			<p>Corvums are a crow-like race with dark feathers and sharp
minds. Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short
of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of
any given situation. Itâ€™s hard to say whether the corvums are
distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they
behave the way they do because they are distrusted.
For Personal Gain
It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves.
Sometimes this presents as flexible morals, and at other
times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of
subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty
race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another.
Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum
of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they
face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a
position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working
behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to
great effect.
Too Smart
Corvums are commonly accepted, sometimes begrudgingly,
to be among the smartest of birdfolk. Keen observers,
they trade in information the way others trade goods. They
are hungry for knowledge and leverage it to further their goals
whenever possible. Their undeniable skill in matters of logistics
and planning make them valuable to councils and powerful
individuals alike.

			<h4>CORVUMS TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Corvums character has certain characteristics in common with all other Corvums.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Ability Score Increase.</em>
				</strong>
				Your Intelligence score
increases by 2.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Age.</em>
				</strong>
				Corvums reach adulthood at around 18 years.
They live slightly shorter lives than other birdfolk,
approximately 70 years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Alignment.</em>
				</strong>
				Shrewd and capable, corvums prefer moral
flexibility and are more likely to be neutral than either good
or evil. Nonetheless, corvums see the benefit of rules, even if
many attempt to turn them to their own advantage. Because of
this they favor lawful alignments.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Size.</em>
				</strong>
				Corvums cut imposing figures, standing between 4
and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, encompassing a variety
of different builds. They weigh around 100 pounds. Your size
is Medium.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Speed.</em>
				</strong>
				Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Glide.</em>
				</strong>
				Using your feathered arms, you can slow your
fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your
reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and
slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently
at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may
fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose,
although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in
the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while
carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may
drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your
arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you
are encumbered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Talons</em>
				</strong>
				Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and
while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4
piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength
(Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could
reasonably grip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Learned.</em>
				</strong>
				You gain proficiency in one of the following
skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Appraising Eye.</em>
				</strong>
			You have an almost supernatural ability to
appraise objects. By spending an action examining any object,
you can determine any magical properties the item has, how
they might be used or activated, as well as a fair estimation of
market price. Using this skill strains the eyes, and you must
complete a long or short rest before you can use it again.
			</p>
			
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Subrace.</em>
				</strong>
			There are two main subraces of corvum:
dusk and kindled. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
