		<description>
			<p>The gallus commonly dwell in small, familial communities
as opposed to the grand perches of the Wood. Of the
birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the
humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love
of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their
social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their
neighbours and promote the common good. They are polite
but have little patience for deceit and rudeness.
A Varied Folk
The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different
varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are
pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble
chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers,
colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace.
The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point
of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a
knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.
Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the
gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to
include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus
culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to
guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s
story about a meal growing too cold to eat as the gallus
continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.
Salt of the Earth
Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form
close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense
of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves
children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus
families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as
farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all
community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give
to their neighbors in a time of need.
While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for
their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal
skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point
of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear
for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies
and dishonesty.

			<h4>GALLUS TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Gallus character has certain characteristics in common with all other Gallus.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Ability Score Increase.</em>
				</strong>
				Your Charisma score
increases by 2.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Age.</em>
				</strong>
				While ages fluctuate, gallus reach maturity around 18
and can live anywhere between 70 and 100 years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Alignment.</em>
				</strong>
			Most gallus are lawful good. They are a salt-ofthe-
earth sort of folk who believe in justice, the value of hard
work, and the importance of respecting others.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Size.</em>
				</strong>
				Gallus are the most varied of the birdfolk races, ranging
from just under 4 feet to just over 5 feet tall, and showing
many unique builds. The variety of shapes and sizes means they also encompass a variety of weights, but most average
around 90 pounds. Your size is Medium.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Speed.</em>
				</strong>
				Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Glide.</em>
				</strong>
				Using your feathered arms, you can slow your
fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your
reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and
slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently
at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may
fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose,
although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in
the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while
carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may
drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your
arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you
are encumbered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Wing Flap.</em>
				</strong>
				As a bonus action, you can use your powerful
feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to
half your movement speed. You can use it in conjunction with
a regular jump, but not while gliding.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Communal</em>
				</strong>
				Whenever you make an Intelligence (History)
check related to the history of your race, culture, or community,
you are considered proficient in the History skill and add
double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your
normal proficiency bonus.
			</p>
            <p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Militia Training</em>
				</strong>
				You have proficiency in simple weapons.
			</p>
             <p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Of The People</em>
				</strong>
				You gain proficiency with the artisan
tools of your choice: brewer’s supplies, carpenter’s tools, or
smith’s tools.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Subrace.</em>

				As a huden gallus, you are of the land. Like the Amaranthine
Hanera, you have a unique connection to the Great
Rhythm of nature, and in return the Rhythm grants you many
gifts. This innate bond with nature may alienate you from city
life, but you will always have a home within the more remote
parts of the Wood.

				Your connection to the Great Rhythm is
such that you can speak with the greenery of the forest itself.
Through speech and touch you can communicate simple ideas
to living plants. You are able to interpret their responses
in simple language. Plants in the Wood do not experience
the world in terms of sight, but most can feel differences
in temperature, describe things that have touched them,
as well as hear vibrations that happened around them
(including speech).</p>
