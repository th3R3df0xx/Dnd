			<p>You are not the kind who goes unnoticed. The gleam in your eye and the smirk at the corner of your mouth show everyone that you are not to be messed with. After all, you have already proven yourself, and people love to spread word of these kinds of exploits. You know how to fight, that is certain, but you have always done so with manners, and your feats of arms are the talk of the local inns.</p>

                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One musical instrument or type of gaming set</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>A condottiere wins most of their fights without having to deal a single strike: it only takes their opponents a good, long glance to think better of it. Their companions are glad to have such a seasoned combatant by their side. And when push comes to shove, a condottiere is not afraid to uphold and even reinforce their reputation. They are probably not indifferent to the glory they reap, but it does not make their intentions any less noble. Deep down, they know their limits better than anyone else.</p>

			<p>You behave with such confidence that you can easily get people to fear or respect you, particularly in places where swagger of this kind goes a long way (barracks, taverns, slums, etc.) So long as you do not take things too far and do not go looking for trouble with the wrong people, you are generally left alone. And provided you have not managed to get on their bad side, people are well-disposed toward you, preferring to count you an ally rather than an enemy.</p>
