      <p>The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen
		dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection
		from predators and shadows within which one can conceal
		themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those
		who would use the cover of darkness to conceal others from
		threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings.
		The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery.
		Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through
		the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one
		can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves
		and their companions safe while journeying through
		the darkness.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability
		to see more clearly in dark and dim conditions. You can see
		in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
		in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light.
		You can’t discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
		When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within
		120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or
		nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern
		color in the darkness, only shades of gray. At 8th level, you can see
		normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical within 120 feet.
		Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth
		hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the
		powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet
		of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier
		(a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight only functions
		while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once
		you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you
		have completed a long rest.</p>

		You may choose the order in which creatures within the

		Additionally, any creature you put to sleep cannot be

		50 feet beyond that. The darkness and shadows overlap and

		Enemies within the shadows constantly feel the presence
