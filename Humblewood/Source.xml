			<p>In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled
between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums
an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants,
is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall
as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique
to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and
				the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and itâ€™s bountiful resources.</p>
