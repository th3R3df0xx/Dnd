			<p>Strigs are the most imposing of the birdfolk races. Resembling
owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings
have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the
birdfolk races. They value strength and endurance, traits they
believe crucial for survival in the Wood. Although they are not
necessarily prejudiced against those who are weaker, strigs are
quick to call out when someone is not doing their best for the
common good.</p>
			<h4>Strong and Brave</h4>
			<p>
				
While many of the birdfolk races rely on their prowess or
intelligence for superiority, strigs use their immense strength
and stamina to endure even the most punishing assault. They
make mighty warriors, and whether defending their perch or
braving the Wood itself, strigs never shy away from a fight.
Strig culture is largely based on principles of strength
and endurance above all, but not necessarily for the purposes
of combat. Protecting and providing for others in hard
times is considered just as impressive, if not more so, than
winning a fight.</p>

			<p>
				Strigs, more than any of the other birdfolk race, are most at
home in the wild. Their mottled feather patterns, though not
as bright or beautiful as others, allow them to easily hide in the
forest. Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed
and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers.
Strigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the
machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic
tendencies, they are capable of forming familial
and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single
physical home.
