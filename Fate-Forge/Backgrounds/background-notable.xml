			<p>Many people would have liked to grow up in such a comfortable environment as yours. Whether you are from the nobility, from the upper middle class, or from an influential family of notables of the Free City, you have never wanted for anything. You have been spared most of the turmoil and trouble that plague the common man but does that make you a happier person? What you cannot ignore, however, is that you are widely respected at least, seemingly—sometimes feared, often envied, and occasionally hated. But whatever the opinion others have of you, your words are almost always heeded. Whether it seems natural to you or keeps puzzling you, the fact is that your voice carries more weight than most.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Nobles, burghers, and other members of the privileged castes of Eana who take up the mantle of an adventurer must usually learn to live in less comfortable conditions that those they have been used to. Such a transition is a lesson of humility for the haughtiest of them. This can result in tensions, but notables are usually able to get along with their less fortunate companions in time.</p>

			<p>In most civilized environments, you have no trouble making your opinion respected, or at least voicing it. Even if your parentage is not known locally, people can easily see that you have the bearing of a well-to-do. Provided a community is not overtly hostile to you, you can get an audience with the local authorities within a shorter time than normal. However, be careful not to boast too loudly about your prerogatives, lest you start attracting other people’s contempt or jealousy.</p>
