			<p>When the birdfolk think of hunters or rangers, they picture
a raptor. Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of
prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them
effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift
and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely
prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves
hunted.</p>
			<h4>Perceptive Awareness</h4>
			<p>
				
Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be
distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the
wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly
keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only
ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have
an extremely wide field of awareness.
Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled
hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for
their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey
from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey
could not predict.</p>
			<H4>Natural Predator</H4>
			<p>
				While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal,
raptors donâ€™t have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they
tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt
a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply
live in the vast forests of the Wood itself.
Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming
relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature,
raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even
familial ties.

			<h4>RAPTOR TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Raptor character has certain characteristics in common with all other Raptor.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Ability Score Increase.</em>
				</strong>
				Your Dexterity score
increases by 2.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Age.</em>
				</strong>
				Raptors reach maturity around 20 years. They can live
longer than any other birdfolk race, over 100 years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Alignment.</em>
				</strong>
				Raptors tend towards neutral alignments.
Preferring the path of naturalists and hunters, raptors rarely
see value in order for the sake of order, and are often more
pragmatic than idealistic.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Size.</em>
				</strong>
				Raptors are lean, muscular hunters, but they stand
less than 4 feet tall. Their light builds usually lend themselves
to bodies that weigh far less than one would expect for their
height, averaging around only 35 pounds. Your size is Small.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Speed.</em>
				</strong>
				Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Glide.</em>
				</strong>
				Using your feathered arms, you can slow your
fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your
reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and
slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently
at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may
fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose,
although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in
the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while
carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may
drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your
arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you
are encumbered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Talons</em>
				</strong>
				Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and
while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4
piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength
(Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could
reasonably grip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Keen Senses</em>
				</strong>
				You have proficiency in the Perception skill
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Woodland Hunter.</em>
				</strong>
				Your accuracy allows you to treat
three-quarters cover as half cover and half cover as no cover.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Hunter's Training</em>
				</strong>
				You have proficiency with the longbow,
short bow, and spear. Additionally, your familiarity
with the longbow means that it is not considered a heavy
weapon for you.
18 Chapter
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Subrace.</em>
				</strong>
				There are two main subraces of raptor:
mistral and maran. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
