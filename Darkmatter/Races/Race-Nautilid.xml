            <p>
A race of universe-spanning travelers, the hulking, fishlike
nautilids patrol space in their massive whorl ships,
exploring and cataloging any planet with enough water to
sustain a colony. Few ever see these creatures’ true forms,
for they are most often concealed in imposing suits, which
look more like antique diving gear than sophisticated
survival apparatuses.</p>
<h4>Orphan Race</h4>
<p>Though the nautilids are among the oldest races in the
‘verse, they are fast dying out. Long after the nautilids
discovered Dark Matter technology and started traversing
the universe, disaster struck their homeworld, Poseidon,
a vast planet of endless ocean. Their star began to grow
rapidly in size, first heating the water, then boiling the
oceans away; within a few short decades, a supernova
claimed the planet, leaving only scattered colonies and
immense nautilid colony ships.
 Without a homeworld, the nautilids have been an
orphan race, growing up on small colonies and inside
massive colony ships called whorls, which travel the
universe. Their numbers dwindle with each decade that
passes, and if nothing changes, the next few centuries
might see the end of the nautilids altogether. 
</p>
<h4>Endless Odyssey</h4>
<p>Ingenious and never to be defeated, the nautilids have
searched tirelessly, jumping from planet to planet in
pursuit of a new homeworld. The oceans of Poseidon had
a very specific aquatic composition of rare elements and
dissolved gases, known as the Poseidon Solution. Though
nautilids can live in both air and water, they do so uncomfortably, and can only relax (and produce offspring)
in a similar solution.
 So far, the Poseidon Solution hasn't been found
occurring naturally on planets with oceans; it has only
been reproduced in quantities small enough to fill the
nautilid whorl ships and their aqua suits. Finding oceans
in the ‘verse is rare enough, but finding a suitable
replacement for Poseidon has been a centuries-long
challenge for the entire nautilid race.</p>

                    <i>Aqua Suit</i>
                </b>
                 Except when you are aboard a whorl ship,
you wear a bulky aqua suit, which is filled with Poseidon
Solution, in order to breathe comfortably. The suit covers
your whole body, including a large domed helmet with
circular windows that allow you to see without hindrance. 
Without the suit, you can breathe air or water, but doing so
delivers air inefficiently to your lungs, and you feel much
the same as a human does in very thin air. You can don
or doff the helmet on your turn as part of your action, and
you can don or doff the entire suit in 1 minute.
 If damaged directly but not completely destroyed, the
suit rapidly mends itself, leaking only a very small amount
of water.
 While wearing the suit, your AC equals 13 + your
Dexterity modifier. Other armor can be fitted to attach
around the aqua suit at no cost. While no other armor is
fitted to it, you count as being unarmored for the purposes
of features such as Unarmored Defense. Additionally,
while wearing the suit, you have resistance to fire damage.
 The suit counts as a life suit and is also equipped with
an embedded universal translator magic item, which you
can use at will.
