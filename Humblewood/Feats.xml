        <p><i>Prerequisite: Glide trait</i></p>
        <p>Your feathered arms are much stronger and more wing-like
than others of your kind. You gain the following benefits:
Your feathered arms make it easier to jump. You no longer
need to move at least 10 feet to perform long and high
jumps. You may choose whether the jump uses your
Strength or Dexterity score for determining height or
distance, and you double the distance you would normally
leap in either case.
You may take the Dash action while gliding to fly an additional
distance up to your movement speed.
You may change direction freely while gliding, and may
gain up to 10 feet of altitude once before you finish
your descent.</p>

made you skilled at sizing up opponents. You gain the following
benefits:

(Investigation) check against any creature you have
seen fight. As long as you succeed against a DC of 10 +
their challenge rating, you can learn one useful fact of your
choice about the target’s combat abilities. Choose from:
• one damage resistance or immunity
• one condition immunity
• one special ability possessed by the creature that
either does damage, or prevents damage
• one option under their attack, legendary, or
reaction actions
• one special sense they possess
