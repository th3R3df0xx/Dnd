            <p>
The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk,
hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the
Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble
hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far
tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to
pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their
sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who
display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor
and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation
as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born
of cowardice, their behaviour stems from a desire to respect the
feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be
of utmost importance in hedge society.</p>
<h4>Sensitive and Kind</h4>
<p>Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend
to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest
beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity.
They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict
mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or
emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.
Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They
are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is
not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which
must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never
known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation,
coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living
creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a
serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly
and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of
their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.
One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy
and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the
emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as
much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional
wounds run deep with hedges</p>
<h4>One With the Forest</h4>
<p>Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm,
hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to
the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted
hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with
the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and
the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common
for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share
their home.
Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer
to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees.
Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature,
near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting
areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces
between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a
few small gardens wherever they live.</p>
<H4>Dressed for Comfort</H4>
<p>Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes,
and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other
clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively
flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming
smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their
quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can
ruin a hedge’s clothing.
Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available
in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors
throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to
suit a hedge’s needs.</p>

time, with many reaching 120 years or more.         </p>

              Hedges are compassionate, empathetic, and
diplomatic, tending towards good alignments. They also favor
neutral alignments, as hedges have a great respect for the
balance of nature.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">

            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Natural Burrowers</i>
                </b>
               You have a burrowing speed of
15 feet. You are capable of burrowing through soil, but are
unable to dig through anything more substantial with just
your clawed hands.

               The backs of hedges are covered with
spiny quills, which makes it impossible for hedges to wear
armor. These quills provide exceptional protection, therefore

modifier. Even though you can’t wear armor, you can still
benefit from the armor class bonus provided by shields so
long as you are proficient with them.

        <description>
            <p>
              You can use your action to curl up, exposing
attackers to a wall of your toughened quills. While curled
up you cannot move, attack, or cast spells with somatic
components, and your base armor class becomes 19. You
cannot benefit from any Dexterity bonus to armor class
while curled up, but you can still use shields.
Any creature that misses you with a melee
attack while you are curled up takes 2d4 points
of piercing damage from your sharp quills. If a
creature hits you while you are curled up, you
are knocked prone in your space at the end
of the turn. You may uncurl yourself at
any point during your turn.
