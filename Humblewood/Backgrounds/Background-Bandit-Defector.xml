		<description>
			<p>You were once a member of the Bandit Coalition,
				moving from place to place, ambushing and robbing passing
				merchants. Something made you decide that path was no
				longer worth pursuing, and you left that life behind. But quitting
				the Bandit Coalition isn’t so easy.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set or Musical Instrument, Disguise Kit.</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>a knife, a cooking pot, a winter blanket, an
					object you received as your cut from a successful robbery, a set
					of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Bandit Specialty</h5>
			<p> The Bandit Coalition is a rather loose organization of
rogues and brigands, but there is still a degree of specialization
within the ranks. This ensures that everyone knows what their
job is and lessens confusion in the heat of a robbery. You can
select your bandit specialty from the Bandit Specialty table, or
roll randomly.

				<b>Lookouts</b> typically typically watch the roads for any signs of Perch
				Guard patrols, signalling the team to bail if a heist looks too
				risky. They also keep an eye out for potential marks.
				<b>Lifters</b> are the specialist thieves of an operation. They are
				usually as adept at pick-pocketing as they are at sneaking up
				behind a cart to liberate its valuables.
				<b>Thugs</b> are the muscle of a bandit group, and use their
				size and strength to intimidate merchants into giving up
				without a fight. They also keep other bandits in line, at the
				captain’s discretion.
				<b>Runners</b> are the messengers and scouts of the Coalition,
				serving to smuggle pilfered goods to fences. Additionally, they
				pass information throughout the different camps of the organization.
				Their job often finds them working alone which makes
				them particularly vulnerable.
				<b>Hustlers</b> are inveterate con-artists. Through careful
				planning and execution, their diversions can keep cart drivers
				occupied just long enough for the lifters to do their work, or
				create a seamless opening for an ambush.
				<b>Captains</b> are the glue that holds each bandit team together,
				providing leadership, and stamping out dissention where
				necessary, often with force. They are figures that inspire with
				their skill and bravado.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Those who have chosen to leave the Coalition behind have
				not made the choice lightly. Some wrestle with their doubts,
				still caring deeply about the friends they left behind, while
				others have forsaken their former lives entirely.</p>
