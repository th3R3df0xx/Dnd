			<p>Some spend their lives sheltered from the perils of the untamed world, but without these dangers, your existence would be absolutely devoid of interest. This merciless nature that so many fear, you love it for its serenity, its majesty, and its impartiality—qualities that towns and their denizens too often lack. You have lost count of the miles you have walked, the forests you have crossed, and the mountains you have scaled, but you keep a vivid memory of each land you have traveled. Sometimes, you feel tired and weary, but at every dawn, the horizon shows you a new face, more resplendent than that of the previous day. Before you became an adventurer for good, you may have worked as a guide, poacher, lumberjack, or huntsman, but your hunger for gold or for faraway lands took your wanderlust to another level.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Most explorers have always had a taste for adventure. Never able to stay put, they spontaneously found an outlet for their restlessness in exploration. Casting their lot with people from other walks of life, however, is a novelty for a good part of them. They have to adapt to people who are not necessarily used to hoofing ten miles a day or to venturing into unexplored regions. They also must accept their companions and, eventually, recognize that they are not just burdens and have worthwhile skills that the explorer could learn from.</p>

			<p>Necessity and experience have taught you to live without a roof above your head. You can find shelter from the foulest weather, identify the best natural places to rest your aching legs, and forage enough food for you and up to four companions, provided you are in a plentiful enough natural environment.</p>
