            <p>
                Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn’t entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.

            <h4>VULPIN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your vulpin character has the following traits.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Ability Score Increase.</i>
                </b>
                Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Age.</i>
                </b>
                Vulpins mature at an average pace, and can be comparatively long-lived. They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Alignment.</i>
                </b>
                Vulpins aren’t innately evil, but their difficulty
                empathizing with others means they are only rarely good
                aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring
                chaotic alignments over lawful ones.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">

                Vulpins cut dashing figures and are usually lean and
                muscular. They stand between 4 and a half and 5 and a half
                feet tall, but are relatively lightweight, weighing between 90

                </b>
                You are adept at hunting at night. You can see

                attack roll and damage bonus.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
