			<p>Not everyone may believe you, but for you there is no doubt about it: you are able to communicate with
                spirits. The spirits of animals, the spirit of every object, the spirits of storms and rivers… maybe even the
                spirits of the dead. You may not have complete mastery over your talent, but you feel the auras, hear the voices,
                and receive the visions. Were you born with this gift, or did it strike you at a momentous time?
                If your culture of origin traditionally accepts gifted people such as you, your condition probably did not bring
                you any trouble, but if you were part of a more skeptical or superstitious society, you most likely had to deal
                with bullying, slander, and perhaps even the threat of being burned at the stake. Fortunately, whatever your
                community was like, you received help from people who see in you an intermediary with the afterlife.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>All animists are aware of their uniqueness. Some take advantage of the influence it grants them while others
                genuinely seek to help other people. However, all are aware that their talent is not universally recognized and
                that they are often taken for madmen or charlatans. Among groups of adventurers, it is rare for every party
                member to be amenable to what might pass for hocus-pocus, but as long as the animist does not overstep any
                boundaries, they should, at worst, only suffer bemused smiles from the more incredulous of their companions.
                Communion with souls is not always the main subject of preoccupation for a hero with this background, but it
                is generally a recurring theme.</p>

			<p>Within any community, you can find people interested in your spiritual experiments, willing to listen to you and
                aid you. Some of them even get teary-eyed when you mention the possibility of speaking with the invisible and
                the heavens. In time, you have learned to recognize these more receptive individuals who will be glad to lend you
                a hand if you are in trouble. You can always rely on being welcomed and supported (possibly in financial ways)
                by a generally small part of the population, provided you bring them what they expect from you.</p>
