			<p>You afflict a creature you can see within range with a crippling cold that fills its entire body. The creature immediately takes 3d10 cold damage, then must make a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the spell for the duration. A creature that is immune to cold damage is unaffected by this spell. An affected creature's movements are slowed by the oppressive cold filling its body. Its speed is halved; it suffers a â€“2 penalty to its AC; it has disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity saving throws; it has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells; it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both; and it can't take reactions. At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect onitself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 3d10 cold damage.

			<p class="indent">A line of frigid wind 120 feet long and 15 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration.

The area is lightly obscured, exposed flames in the area are doused, and ranged attack rolls in the area have disadvantage. Thick snow coats the ground in the area, making it difficult terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the blizzard appears, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. If a creature is flying when it fails this saving throw, the creature falls to the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are unaffected by this spell. Additionally, you may designate a number of other creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier to also be unaffected by this spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>
				You attempt to turn one creature that you can see
				within range into solid ice. The creature must make
				a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is
				restrained as its body begins to harden, and it gains
				vulnerability to fire damage. On a successful save,
				the creature isnâ€™t affected. A creature that is immune
				to cold damage is unaffected by this spell.
				A creature restrained by this spell must make
				another Constitution saving throw at the end of
				each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this
				spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves
				three times, it is turned to ice and subjected to the
				petrified condition (except for its continued
				vulnerability to fire damage) for the duration. The
				successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive;
				keep track of both until the target collects three of a
				kind. If the affected creature takes fire damage, it
				has advantage on its next saving throw.
				If the creature is physically broken while frozen, it
				suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its
				original state.
				If you maintain your concentration on this spell
				for the entire possible duration, the creature is
				turned to ice until the effect is removed.

			<p>
				You attempt to instantly freeze a target solid.
				Choose one Medium or smaller creature you can see
				within range. If that creature fails a Constitution
				saving throw, it freezes in place and is paralyzed for
				the duration.
				A creature that is immune to cold damage is
				unaffected by this spell and a creature that is
				resistant to cold damage has advantage on the
				saving throw.
				As long as a creature is paralyzed by this spell, it
				has vulnerability to fire damage. However, if the
				creature takes at least 10 points of fire damage at
				once, that creature is no longer affected by this spell.
				An affected creature can repeat the saving throw
				at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
				itself on a success.

				You cause thick frost to form around a creature's

				You create sheets of ice on one or more solid
				surfaces within range. Each sheet is a 5-foot-square
				panel that's 1 foot thick, and you can create a
				number of sheets up to your spellcasting ability
				modifier. The panels can be in any orientation as
				long as at least one edge of each panel is anchored
				to a solid surface or another panel, although a
				particularly lopsided structure may collapse.
				If a panel cuts through a creature's space when it
				appears, that creature is pushed to the nearest
				unoccupied space and must make a Dexterity saving
				throw, taking 2d8 cold damage on a failed save or
				half as much damage on a successful one.
				As a bonus action on each of your turns for the
				duration, you can create or dissolve any number of
				panels, as long as there are never more panels in
				place at one time than your spellcasting ability
				modifier.
				These sheets of ice are objects that can be
				damaged and therefore breached. Each panel has AC
				10 and 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire
				damage.

				Ice Cave
				7th-level conjuration
				Casting Time: 1 action
				Range: Self
				Components: V, S, M (a hollow glass orb)
				Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
				You encase your surroundings with ice, locking
				yourself and nearby creatures in a cave-like prison of
				ice. The maximum size of the enclosure is a 60-footradius
				sphere centered on you, but sturdy surfaces
				will be lined with ice to form the interior contours
				of the area. The ice is 6 inches thick where layered
				onto existing surfaces, and 3 feet thick where freestanding.
				If the ice cuts through a creature's space, the
				creature is pushed either inside or outside the
				enclosure (your choice). When the ice appears, you
				can cause up to 10 icy stalactites or stalagmites to
				form, jabbing abruptly inward from the walls, floor,
				or ceiling of the ice cave. Each spike is 5 feet long
				and 3 feet wide at the base. A creature whose space
				gets spiked must make a Dexterity saving throw,
				taking 2d8 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage per
				spike on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
				successful one.
				As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can
				cause up to 5 spikes to erupt or dissolve (or a mix of
				both).

				much damage on a successful one. A non-flying
				creature within the area takes 5d10 bludgeoning
				damage and is abruptly tossed 50 feet in the air
				above the mountain.
				The entire mountain is made of ice, and is
				therefore subject to melting and other natural forces
				as normal, leaving behind a 1-foot-deep crater if
				entirely removed.

				You conjure a barrier of ice to block incoming

				triggering attack. If the attack still hits, the ice is
				shattered but absorbs some of the impact, reducing

				If the triggering attack misses, then the ice shield
				fuses to the ground to create a 4 foot by 4 foot
				barrier that's 4 inches thick and can provide cover.
				(If you are flying or otherwise not on a solid surface,
				then the ice simply falls.) This ice wall has AC 10 and
				20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. The
				ice is nonmagical after being conjured, and will thus
				melt naturally.

				You conjure a medium creature made of magical
				ice in the shape of a humanoid warrior. The ice
				warrior appears in an unoccupied space you can see
				within range, and disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit
				points or when the spell ends. It is considered an

				The summoned warrior is friendly to you and your
				companions. The warrior acts immediately after you
				in the initiative order. It obeys any verbal commands
				you issue to it (no action required by you), but its
				abilities are limited (see below). If you don't issue
				any commands to the warrior, it defends itself from
				hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
				The ice warrior cannot take any actions except the
				Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. It has the
				statistics of a veteran (Monster Manual page 350)
				except that it cannot speak, its longsword attack is
				always one-handed, it deals an extra 1d4 cold damage
				on a hit, and it lacks the shortsword and crossbow
				attack options. Additionally, it has vulnerability to
				fire damage and immunity to cold, necrotic, and
				poison damage.

				You conjure a two-inch wide ball of ice and snow
				in your hand, which you can launch at your foes as a
				bonus action. When you do so, choose a point you
				can see within range. The snowball streaks toward
				that point, then detonates in a frigid blast with a
				5-foot radius. Each creature within the blast must
				make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 cold
				damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
				a successful save.
				If you choose not to launch the snowball
				immediately, you can spend your action on future
				turns to increase the spell's power. For each action
				spent empowering the snowball, the size of the
				damage dice improves by one step. The damage dice
				cannot improve beyond d12s. Similarly, each action
				spent empowering the snowball increases the radius
				of the blast by 5 feet, up to a maximum radius of 25
				feet.
				If the spell ends before you launch the snowball, it
				detonates at its current power level. If the snowball
				cannot reach the target point (for example, if you
				targeted a point on the other side of a pane of glass)
				then it detonates upon striking a barrier.
				At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a

				You transform yourself into a being of pure flame.
				You retain your size category and general shape, as
				well as your existing features and abilities, and for
				the duration you gain the following benefits.
				You glow with an orange light, shedding bright
				light out to a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
				additional 30 feet. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
				Whenever a creature moves to within 10 feet of
				you, starts its turn there, or hits you with a melee
				attack, that creature takes 5d10 fire damage. You
				have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing,
				and fire damage.
				You can cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell without
				expending a spell slot. Whenever you roll fire
				damage for a spell you cast, roll dice that are one
				step larger than normal. For example, a spell that
				normally deals 8d6 fire damage would deal 8d8 fire
				damage instead.

				You cause a mighty tornado of fire to erupt,
				trapping your enemies in a hellish inferno.
				Choose a point you can see on the ground within
				range. The vortex forms with an interior radius
				between 5 and 20 feet (your choice) surrounded by 1-
				foot-thick flames, which are opaque. The vortex
				reaches 60 feet upwards, and the diameter at the
				top is double the diameter of the bottom.
				When the vortex appears, each creature whose
				space is crossed by the flames must make a Dexterity
				saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8
				fire damage and is pulled into an unoccupied space
				inside the vortex (if possible). On a successful save, a
				creature takes half as much damage and is not
				pulled in. A creature who is not pulled in, either due
				to a successful save or a lack of space, is pushed out
				to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
				flames (if possible).
				A creature trapped inside the vortex can use its
				action to try and force its way through the flames to
				escape. To do so, it makes a Strength saving throw.
				On a successful save, it pushes through the flames
				and exits the vortex, unless there is not enough
				space for it or it does not have enough movement to
				leave. On a failed save, the creature remains in the
				vortex. In either case, the creature trying to push
				through the flames takes 6d8 fire damage.
				If a trapped creature does not attempt to push
				through the flames and does not otherwise escape
				the vortex on its turn, that creature takes 3d8 fire
				damage at the end of its turn.

					You summon a 4-foot-diameter ball of crackling

					When you cast the spell, you launch the ball at a
					creature you can see within range. The target must
					make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning
					damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
					a successful save.
					At the start of the targeted creature's turn, the ball
					changes direction to launch itself at the nearest
					other creature within 30 feet. The new target must
					save against the spell's damage. This process repeats
					for the duration of the spell.
					If two creatures are tied for the nearest, the new
					target is selected randomly from among them. If no
					new target is in range, the ball waits until a creature
					comes within 30 feet and then launches.

					Lightning Tether
					8th-level evocation
					Casting Time: 1 action
					Range: 150 feet
					Components: V, S, M (strands of glass filigree)
					Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
					You cause tendrils of lightning to spring forth out
					of the ground, walls, ceilings, or other sturdy
					surfaces to grasp and hold your enemies. A number
					of creatures you can see up to twice your
					spellcasting ability modifier must each succeed on a
					Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the spell. A
					creature more than 20 feet from any solid surface is
					unaffected.
					An affected creature is leashed by animated
					lightning and instantly pulled to its anchoring
					surface. The creature's speed becomes zero. At the
					beginning of an affected creature's turn, that
					creature takes 5d12 lightning damage.
					A creature can break free by spending an action
					and succeeding on a Strength check against your
					spell save DC. Regardless of whether the check
					succeeds or fails, the creature takes 5d12 lightning
					damage as it strains against the tether.
					If a tethered creature casts a spell, it must make a
					Constitution saving throw as though concentrating.
					On a failed save, the spell is wasted with no effect.

					You create an electrical imbalance to generate a
					magnetic pull. Choose a metal object that weighs no
					more than 20 pounds. If the object is not being worn
					or carried and is not otherwise restrained, it flies
					toward you where you can either catch it or let it
					fall at your feet. If the target is fastened to a solid
					surface or otherwise prevented from moving, it may
					be possible to pull it free with an ability check using
					your spellcasting ability, at the DM's discretion.
					If the targeted object is being carried, the wielder
					must make a Dexterity save or have the object
					pulled from its grasp and fly toward you as
					described above. If the object is being worn (such as
					one of the plates of a suit of armor), the wearer
					must instead make a Strength saving throw or be
					pulled 15 feet toward you.
					Alternatively, you can target a creature that is
					made largely of metal (such as an iron golem). Such
					a creature is affected in the same way as a creature
					wearing a targeted object, as described above.

					You transform yourself in a being of pure lightning

					and abilities, and for the duration you gain the
					following benefits.
					You glow with a yellow or blue light (your choice),
					shedding bright light out to a 30-foot radius and dim
					light for an additional 30 feet. You gain a flying
					speed of 60 feet, and can choose to pass through
					solid objects, although you take 2d10 force damage if
					you end your turn inside a solid object.
					You have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and
					slashing damage. You are also immune to lightning
					damage, and any effect that would deal lightning
					damage to you instead grants you that many
					temporary hit points. Any creature that hits you
					with a melee attack takes 4d12 lightning damage.
					You can cast lightning bolt as a 3rd-level spell
					without expending a spell slot. All your spells and
