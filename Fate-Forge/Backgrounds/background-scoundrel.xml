			<p>You have taken part in less-than-legal businesses for quite some time. You are a person of the world, oh yes.
                The underworld offers many career opportunities, and you may have tried your hand at several of them. In
                the eyes of many, it is a perverse, rotten universe, but to you, it is a complicated, turbulent family among which
                both camaraderie and treachery can be found at every turn.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Deception, Investigation, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> thieves’ tools, disguise kit, or forgery kit</li>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> One language of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>A set of common clothes, various forged documents, the tools you are proficient in, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Adventurers with a criminal background are plentiful. Most, but not all, take this path out of greed. Some see in it a way to make a name for themselves, to perform beyond the uneasy tedium of their questionable activities. When their traveling companions are aware of their origins, they tend to be wary of such a disreputable individual, but such suspicion rapidly fades if there is nothing on which to ground it. Characters with this background tend to have particularly troublesome bonds.</p>

			<p>You can smell out corruption. Most communities have their share of criminals and crooked officials. Obviously, you cannot spot whether someone is involved in such dealings at a glance, but you can readily find unlawful people whom you can negotiate with or ask for information. From this point onward, what happens is up to you, but you know what you are getting into.</p>
