			<p>Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to
their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their
eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller
than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons.
Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent
colours, something which can be seen as either alluring or
unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with
hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an
outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts
to the role.</p>
			<h4>Touched</h4>
			<p>
				
To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and
distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low
intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the
world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon
way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.
These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be
improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural
gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical
scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation
for some time in Humblewood.</p>
			<H4>Of Two Worlds</H4>
			<p>
				While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a
hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb
the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have
an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing
among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships
among families and friends.
Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society
of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing
factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in
larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring
the company of those who understand them rather than
those who pass judgement.

			<h4>LUMAS TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Luma character has certain characteristics in common with all other Lumas.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Ability Score Increase.</em>
				</strong>
				Your Charisma score
increases by 2.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Age.</em>
				</strong>
				Lumas are short-lived reaching adulthood around 20
years. Few lumas live beyond 70 years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Alignment.</em>
				</strong>
			Spurred by personal interests and flights of
fancy, lumas lean towards chaotic alignments. While generally
good natured, those that have been spurned by society find
it hard to see the benefits of altruism, but even under such
circumstances lumas are rarely evil.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Size.</em>
				</strong>
				Lumas are the shortest and lightest of the birdfolk,
standing roughly 3 feet tall and weighing only around 30
pounds. Your size is Small.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Speed.</em>
				</strong>
				Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Glide.</em>
				</strong>
				Using your feathered arms, you can slow your
fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your
reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and
slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently
at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may
fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose,
although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in
the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while
carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may
drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your
arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you
are encumbered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Wing Flap.</em>
				</strong>
				As a bonus action, you can use your powerful
feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to
half your movement speed. You can use it in conjunction with
a regular jump, but not while gliding.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Touched</em>
				</strong>
				You know one cantrip from the sorcerer spell list.
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.
			</p>
            <p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Fated</em>
				</strong>
				Whether by luck or a guiding presence, you always
seem to find your way. You can choose to reroll any attack,
skill check, or saving throw. You can decide to do this after
your roll, but only before the outcome of the roll has been
determined. You can’t use this feature again until you have
completed a long rest.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Subrace.</em>
				</strong>
				There are two main subraces of lumas: sable and
sera. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
