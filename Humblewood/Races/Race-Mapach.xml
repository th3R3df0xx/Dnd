            <p>
Naturally curious, mapachs are a medium-sized racoon-like
race. They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength
lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around
them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree
of fine motor control that doesn’t diminish with age. They are
also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their
love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as
thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite
good-natured, if a little eccentric.</p>
<h4>Resilient Opportunists</h4>
<p>Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions,
and at intuiting the right course of action when faced
with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some
may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities
rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them.
Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings.
Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by
obvious traps.</p>
<h4>Canny Craftspeople</h4>
<p>One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is
their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack
for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk,
or on-hand materials is known as “scroungecraft”, and is a
cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an
art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other
peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity,
and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who
see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach
hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who
have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity
status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in
loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.</p>
<h4>Hubs of Invention</h4>
<p>Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish
communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of
fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was
responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart’s pulley
system was based. The pulley system was so successful that
birdfolk perches beyond Alderheart have adopted
the technology.            </p>
            <h4>MAPACH TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your mapach character has the following traits.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Ability Score Increase.</i>
                </b>
                Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your constitution score increases by 1.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Age.</i>
                </b>
Mapachs mature quickly, reaching adulthood around
8 years. Despite this they have fairly average lifespans, the
oldest among them living just past 60 years.            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Alignment.</i>
                </b>
               Mapachs don’t favour good over evil, with
most choosing to remain neutral. They also lean towards
the freedom of chaotic alignments.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Size.</i>
                </b>
                Mapachs stand between 4 and 5 feet tall, and encompass
a variety of builds from svelt to wide, weighing between
90 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Speed.</i>
                </b>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Darkvision.</i>
                </b>
                You can see in dim light within 60 feet of
you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Mapachs are most comfortable under the cloak of night.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Languages.</i>
                </b>
                You can speak, read, and write Common
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Expert Climbers.</i>
                </b>
               You have a climb speed of 20 feet.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Resilience.</i>
                </b>
                You have advantage on saving throws against
poison and resistance against poison damage.
            </p>
             <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Skulker.</i>
                </b>
                 You have advantage on
Stealth checks made in dim light
and darkness.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>
                    <i>Scroungecraft.</i>
                </b>
                You are proficient with tinker’s tools.
Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but
functional versions of common items using materials present
in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these
materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30
gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional,
even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article
of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would
logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become
useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1
hour before falling apart. Depending on the materials available, a Game Master
(GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For
example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen
to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound
into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a
passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.
Should you have access to the proper materials, you can
spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted
in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start
this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such
a way will function exactly as a normal version
of the item, and if you have proficiency in the
tools used to craft them, they can even look
professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain
a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance.
You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken
equipment, provided you have the materials
on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold
together is up to the GM.
